### <h1>Employees System Project </h1>

The **Employees System Project** is a Python-based application that demonstrates the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. This project includes three main classes: **Employee, Manager, and Director**, each with distinct roles and permissions. It serves as a foundational example of how OOP concepts can be applied to manage employee data and interactions efficiently.

## Introduction

This project provides a **structured way to manage employees** using OOP principles in Python. Each class represents a different role within a company, **inheriting and extending functionalities accordingly**.

---

## Classes

### Employee

The **Employee** class represents a basic employee with the following attributes:

- `full_name`: The name of the employee.  
- `age`: The age of the employee.  
- `salary`: The salary of the employee.  

This class provides methods for **displaying employee information** in a formatted manner.

### Manager (Inherits from Employee)

The **Manager** class extends the `Employee` class and includes additional functionalities, such as:

- Managing a **list of employees**.  
- **Adding new employees**.  
- **Removing employees** by name.  

### Director (Inherits from Manager)

The **Director** class further extends the `Manager` class with **higher-level privileges**, including:

- **Modifying system-wide settings**.  
- **Overriding employee data**.  
- **Having full control** over the employee management system.

## Features

‚úîÔ∏è **Object-Oriented Design** ‚Äì Implements **inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism**.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Role-Based Access** ‚Äì Employees, Managers, and Directors have different levels of control.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Employee Management** ‚Äì Easily **add, update, and remove** employees.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** ‚Äì Provides an **interactive experience**.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShinNancy/OOP_Python_Projects-Employees-System-Project.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd employeesSystem
```

Run the program:

```

---

## Usage
